excerpt:
  I study evolutionary biology and systematics of short-range endemic arthropods, my research combines fieldwork, museum collection data, morphology and phylogenomics to address specific questions about speciation, species delineation, morphological evolution, and biodiversity. Much of my research also emphasizes conservation biology, taxonomy and bioinformatics! I am extremely passionate about evolution and exploration of caves.

    excerpt: "Ring species is a model of evolution which exemplifies speciation with continuous gene flow, a classic ring species example are the salamanders of the genus *Ensatina*, here we explore this model using False tarantula spiders."

    excerpt: "The genus *Hexurella* includes some of the smallest mygalomorph spiders in the world, and are extremely rare and challenging to collect, here with new records we review the genus, perform species delimitation and provide with important natural history aspects of the group."

    excerpt: "Mygalomorphs have a very particular burrowing behavior, with variable entrances and silk structures like trapdoors and turrets. Here we explored if this burrowing behavior, along with body and range size is correlated with genetic diversity and differentiation."
